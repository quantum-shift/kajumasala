The session begins with setting up the browser logging, and the telemetry feature is enabled for data collection. A warning appears about a beta function called `load`, indicating it is still being developed, which may lead to changes in the API.

I start a task to create a conversational AI agent at the ElevenLabs website, specifically at elevenlabs.io. First, I confirm that the browser is ready for new actions. Next, I search for elevenlabs.io on Google and successfully input the URL into the search bar.

With the search completed, I now have suggestions displayed. I select the link for elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents, aiming to explore the options for creating an AI agent. After a successful navigation to the ElevenLabs page, I find options to either create or try different AI agents.

Next, I click on the button to "Create this AI agent" but encounter a loading issue, requiring me to try again. I then decide to start from a blank template to create my AI agent but discover that the button is not clickable, possibly due to changes on the page.

Undeterred, I switch to filling in the necessary details for the AI agent's setup. I input the name "Eric the Support Agent," followed by a friendly first message: "Hi, I'm Eric. How can I help you today?" I also complete the system prompt, providing guidance on how Eric should interact with customers.

After entering the information, I notice additional fields appear, showing I am nearly done with the setup. I then proceed to fill in the last details and click on "Save" to finalize the creation of the AI agent.

Success! The AI agent "Eric the Support Agent" is set up successfully, equipped with an initial greeting and a system prompt to assist customers effectively. The creation process for this conversational AI agent is now complete, and I confirm that everything works as intended.
