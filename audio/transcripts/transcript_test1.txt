On February 22, 2025, at 10:00 AM, I set up my browser for usage and enabled telemetry to collect anonymized data.

Shortly after, I began a task to visit the website elevenlabs.io to create a conversational AI agent. I first searched for "elevenlabs.io" on Google, successfully entering it into the search bar.

After entering the website, I clicked on the suggestion that led to the conversational AI agent section. I was successfully redirected to the page that provided options for creating or testing conversational AI agents.

Next, I attempted to initiate the creation of a conversational agent by clicking the "Create this AI agent" button. However, it was in a loading state and I could not proceed.

I then decided to fill out the required details for the agent setup instead. I entered the agentâ€™s name as "Eric the Support Agent" and wrote a first message: "Hi, I'm Eric. How can I help you today?" Additionally, I provided a system prompt indicating that Eric is a friendly support agent who answers in a detailed manner.

As I filled in these details, new fields appeared on the page. I completed the system prompt, defining Eric's personality and response style, and then prepared to save my setup.

Finally, I saved the created agent. The process was successful, and I confirmed that the conversational AI agent "Eric the Support Agent" was created and ready to assist customers with an initial greeting and the necessary system prompts.
